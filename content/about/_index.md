"I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the
stars..." - Walt Whitman

"Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting
it in a fruit salad." - Miles Kington


Ecological Foodways: cultural practices that connect humans to the
natural world through what they eat.

The primary limiting factor in food sustainability is consumer
knowledge. Given the impact that food decisions have on the world,
connecting people to their food should be a priority. 

Through historical research, interviews and data journalism
*Ecological Foodways* approaches stories about how our food connects
us to our world.
