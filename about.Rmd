# A bit about me

From a very young age I have been captivated by food. This interest
eventually lead me to persue studies in ecology and environmental
science. As an undergrauate I hunted wild mushrooms and studied fungal
ecology in the redwood forests around Humboldt State University in
California. During my doctoral studies I conducted research on the
evolution of ecological networks at Northern Arizona University and
the University of Bordeaux (France). I then continued this work as a
research fellow at Harvard Forest (Harvard University) where I
conducted research on the response of food-webs to climate
change. When not doing research, I can usually be found foraging,
trail running, open-water swimming and eating.
