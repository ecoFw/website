title: "Ecological Foodways"
---

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Background

* Eating is inherently an ecological act. 
* For example, USDA land-use statistics show that over 50% of the land
  in the contiguous United States is dominated by food production.
* As human beings concentrate into dense urban centers, the distance
  between people and their food continues to increase; however, recent
  scientific research suggests that eating, especially the experience
  of flavor, has major impacts on how people percieve and interact
  with the world.
* Part ecological seminar and part culinary education class, this
  course will use a combination of lecture, discussion and
  food-focused activities to demonstrate and explore the ways that
  food connects people and shapes ecosystems.

# Course Overview

- 6-8 weeks, beginning the week of July 1 at the earliest
- 90 min total: 45 min lecture, 45 min interactive session
- Field trips

## Required Materials

* Notebook (e.g. Composition Book). A central feature of the course
  will be learning how to keep a field notebook as a tool for
  recording ecological and personal observations through journaling.
* Readings will be provided through PDF copies. Please notify the
  instructor if other reading modes are desired.
* Some online videos and resources will also be provided.
