title: "Hawai‘i Climate Smart Agriculture Resources"
---

Agricultural practices are a key adaptation for both addressing
contributing factors to climate change and mitigating
impacts. Resources for supporting current activities and transitions
to CSA practices are increasingly available from multiple sources. The
Hawai‘i CSA Resource Webtool provides a way to more effectively
navigate these resources.

# How to Use the Webtool

- Our team has compiled a database of CSA resources that can be accessed
via a web interface.
- Select the CSA practices of interest. 
- Read about and follow the links to the resources. 
- Information for the selected practices can be exported by clicking
  on the `Download Selected Rows` button. 
- At any time, the selected practices can be cleared and re-selected
  in their entirety using the `Deselect All` and `Select All` buttons.
