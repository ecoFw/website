title: "Ecological Foodways: Explore Your World Through Flavor"
---
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![ecological_foodways](img/ecology-food-culture.png)

Eating is inherently an ecological act. Although the need and desire
to connect to food is increasing, urbanization and globalization
continue to increase the distance between people and their
food. Concomitantly, findings from the new field of neurogastronomy
suggests that food and, especially, flavor have previously
unrecognized impacts on how we perceive and value the world. 

Through a synthesis of current topics in ecology, culinary arts and
the newly developing field of neurogastronomy, this course will:

- Introduce the topic of ecological foodways (i.e. how food links
  humans and nature).
- Explore the underlying neurological and physiological basis of
  flavor and how it influences our world.
- Improve culinary and tasting abilities through hands-on exercises.

## Meetings

- Thursdays 3:30pm-5:00pm from July 18 to August 22. 
- Lasell Village, Froebel 103C
- We will start each day with a brief presentation and discussing a
  topic for the day.
- The rest of the class will be devoted to activities primarily aimed
  at developing culinary and tasting skills related to the topic.

## Required Materials

- Other than an open-mind and desire to learn, nothing is explicitly
  necessary for the course. 
- However, although not required, it is strongly suggested that each
  participant obtain a journal/notebook to keep a journal during and
  (hopefully) after the course. 
- Readings will provided electronically. If other media are required,
  please let the instructor know.
