# The structure of ahupua'a as trusteeships

The communities of the Hawaiian islands devloped organizational
structures with sustainability as a focus. Through a animistic
socio-religious worldview, the relationship among Hawaiians and
between Hawaiians and the natural environment could be shaped and
adapted by the concepts of *ohana* (family), *kapu* (sacredness)
and *mana* (power).

Communities within defined districts (*ahupua'a*) were comprised of 


- *mokupuni*: islands
- *moku*
